    <string name="help_dialog_message">SeekPassword is a software inspired by FlowerPassword. This project is a Android clint. \nSeekPassword is a password calculator that uses a root password (which can be easily remembered) and a distinguishing code (which can be distinguished by application) to calculate an irreversible password. At the same time, it solves the problem of high risk of the same password on multiple platforms and the difficulty of memorizing pure random passwords. For specific recommended password management strategies, please refer to the authorâ€™s article (In Chinese) above .</string>
